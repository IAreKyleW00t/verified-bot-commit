A GitHub Action to create signed and verified commits as the
`github-actions[bot]` User with the standard `GITHUB_TOKEN`. This is
accomplished via the GitHub [REST API] by using the [Blob] and [Tree] endpoints to
build the commit and update the original Ref to point to it. [^1]

The resulting commit will be signed and verified using
[GitHub's public PGP key](https://github.com/web-flow.gpg)!

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Using this Action with your own [Personal Access Token (PAT)] is **not** recommended.  
> See [limitations](#limitations) for more details.

## Quick Start

```yaml
- name: Commit changes
  uses: iarekylew00t/verified-bot-commit@v1
  with:
    message: 'feat: Some changes'
    files: |
      README.md
      *.txt
      src/**/tests/*
      test-data/**
```

## Usage

### Inputs

> `List` type is a newline-delimited string
>
> ```yaml
> files: |
>   *.md
>   example.txt
> ```

| Name              | Type   | Description                                      | Default                   |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `ref`             | String | The ref to push the commit to                    | `${{ github.ref }}`       |
| `files`           | List   | Files/[Glob] patterns to include with the commit | _required_                |
| `message`         | String | Message for the commit [1]                       | _optional_                |
| `message-file`    | String | File to use for the commit message [1]           | _optional_                |
| `force-push`      | String | Force push the commit                            | `false`                   |
| `follow-symlinks` | String | Follow symbolic links when globbing files        | `true`                    |
| `workspace`       | String | Directory containing checked out files           | `${{ github.workspace }}` |
| `token`           | String | GitHub Token for REST API access [2]             | `${{ github.token }}`     |

> 1. You must include either `message` or `message-file` (which takes priority).
> 2. This Action is intended to work with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`. See the
>    [notice](#verified-bot-commit-action) and [limitations](#limitations)

### Outputs

| Name     | Type   | Description                                       |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `blobs`  | JSON   | A JSON list of blob SHAs within the tree          |
| `tree`   | String | SHA of the underlying tree for the commit         |
| `commit` | String | SHA of the commit itself                          |
| `ref`    | String | SHA for the ref that was updated (same as commit) |

### Token Permissions

This Actions requires the following permissions granted to the `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

- `contents: write`

## Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è As always, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot push to protected Refs.

‚ö†Ô∏è The [Blob] API has a 40MiB limit, any files larger than this in your commit
will fail.

‚ö†Ô∏è Using your own [Personal Access Token (PAT)] will result in an unsigned and unverified
commit. You should _really_ look into [using your own keys] and [signing
commits] yourself with the help of Actions like [webfactory/ssh-agent](https://github.com/webfactory/ssh-agent)
and [crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg](https://github.com/crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg).

## Development

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Since this is a TypeScript action you **must** transpile it into native
> JavaScript. This is done for you automatically as part of the `npm run all`
> command and will be validated via the
> [`check-dist.yml`](.github/workflows/check-dist.yml) Workflow in any PR.

1. ‚öôÔ∏è Install the version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) as defined in the
   [`.node-version`](.node-version).  
   You can use [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to help manage your
   project runtimes.

   ```sh
   asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git
   asdf install
   ```

1. üõ†Ô∏è Install dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

1. üèóÔ∏è Format, lint, and package your code changes.

   ```sh
   npm run all
   ```

## Releases

For maintainers, the following release process should be used when cutting new
versions.

1. ‚è¨ Ensure all changes are in the `main` branch and all necessary
   [Workflows](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/actions) are
   passing.

   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git pull
   ```

2. ‚úÖ Ensure the [`package.json`](package.json#L4) and
   [`package-lock.json`](package-lock.json#L3) files are updated to with the new
   version being cut.

   ```sh
   npm update
   ```

3. üîñ Create a new Tag, push it up, then create a
   [new Release](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/releases/new)
   for the version.

   ```sh
   git tag v1.2.3
   git push -u origin v1.2.3
   ```

   Alternatively you can create the Tag on the GitHub Release page itself.

   When the tag is pushed it will kick off the
   [Shared Tags](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/actions/workflows/shared-tags.yml)
   Workflows to update the `v$MAJOR` and `v$MAJOR.MINOR` tags.
