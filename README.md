A GitHub Action to create signed and verified commits as the
`github-actions[bot]` User with the standard `GITHUB_TOKEN`. This is
accomplished via the GitHub [REST API] by using the [Blob] and [Tree] endpoints
to build the commit and update the original Ref to point to it. [^1]

This Action will stage all changed files in your local branch and add those that
match your file patterns to the commit. Afterwards, your local branch will be
updated to point to the newly created commit, which will be signed and verified
using [GitHub's public PGP key](https://github.com/web-flow.gpg)! Files that
were not committed by the Action will be left staged.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Using this Action with your own [Personal Access Token (PAT)] is **not**
> recommended.  
> See [limitations](#limitations) for more details.

> This action supports Linux, macOS and Windows runners (results may vary with
> self-hosted runners).

- `contents: write`

## Examples

### Commit all changes

```yaml
- name: Install regctl
  uses: iarekylew00t/verified-bot-commit@v2
  with:
    message: 'chore: Updates'
    files: |
      **
```

### Commit changes back to a Pull Request

```yaml
- name: Install regctl
  uses: iarekylew00t/verified-bot-commit@v2
  with:
    ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
    message: 'chore: Update README'
    files: |
      README.md
```

### Ignore warnings when no files changed

```yaml
- name: Install regctl
  uses: iarekylew00t/verified-bot-commit@v2
  with:
    if-no-commit: info
    message: 'feat: Some changes'
    files: |
      README.md
```

### Manually stage your own files

```yaml
- name: Stage files
  shell: bash
  run: |
    git add docs/
    git restore --staged docs/something/idont/want

- name: Install regctl
  uses: iarekylew00t/verified-bot-commit@v2
  with:
    auto-stage: false
    message: 'chore: Updating docs'
    files: |
      docs/**
```

### Use a repository in another directory

```yaml
- name: Checkout repo
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    path: my-repo

- name: Update files
  shell: bash
  run: echo 'Hello World!' > my-repo/test.txt

- name: Install regctl
  uses: iarekylew00t/verified-bot-commit@v2
  with:
    workspace: my-repo
    message: 'chore: Updating tests'
    files: |
      test.txt
```

## Limitations

⚠️ As always, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot push to protected Refs.

⚠️ The [Blob] API has a 40MiB limit, any files larger than this in your commit
will fail.

> [!TIP]
>
> You can create a commit with large files using regular git CLI and push it to
> a temporary branch. Then `git log --format=raw` will get you the tree hash,
> which you can use to
> [create a commit](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/git/commits?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-a-commit)
> with Github API.
> [See example](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50055#discussioncomment-13460641).

⚠️ Using your own [Personal Access Token (PAT)] will result in an unsigned and
unverified commit. You should _really_ look into [using your own keys] and
[signing commits] yourself with the help of Actions like
[webfactory/ssh-agent](https://github.com/webfactory/ssh-agent) and
[crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg](https://github.com/crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg).

## Common Errors

Below are some common errors that can occur depending on your use case. This are
issues that are considered outside the scope of this Action but are still
documented here to include common solutions/workarounds for others.

Feel free to create an
[Issue](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/issues) or
[Pull Request](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/pulls) if you
encounter other errors that should be documented here.

### Git Object Errors

If you see errors that contain
`insufficient permission for adding an object to repository database .git/objects`
then this probably means another Action in your Workflow performed a local Git
operations as a different user than what the Runner (usually `root`), which
results in `.git/` files being owned by that user.

You can fix this by updating the permissions of the `.git/` directory to the
back to current user/group.

```yaml
- name: Fix .git permissions
  run: sudo chown -R "$(id -u):$(id -g)" .git
```

## Development

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Since this is a TypeScript action you **must** transpile it into native
> JavaScript. This is done for you automatically as part of the `npm run all`
> command and will be validated via the
> [`check-dist.yml`](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/actions/workflows/check-dist.yml)
> Workflow in any PR.

1. ⚙️ Install the version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) as defined in the
   [`.tool-versions`](.tool-versions).  
   You can use [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to help manage your
   project runtimes.

   ```sh
   asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git
   asdf install
   ```

2. 🛠️ Install dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. 🏗️ Format, lint, test, and package your code changes.

   ```sh
   npm run all
   ```

## Releases

For maintainers, the following release process should be used when cutting new
versions.

1. ⏬ Pull down the latest changes and ensure all
   [Workflows](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/actions) are
   passing.

   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git pull
   ```

2. ✅ Bump the package version.

   ```sh
   npm version <major|minor|patch> -m "chore: Bumping version to vX.Y.Z"
   ```

3. 🔖 Create a new Tag, push it up, then create a
   [new Release](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/releases/new)
   for the version.

   ```sh
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push -u origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

   Alternatively you can create the Tag on the GitHub Release page itself.

   When the tag is pushed it will kick off the
   [Shared Tags](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/actions/workflows/shared-tags.yml)
   Workflows to update the `v$MAJOR` and `v$MAJOR.MINOR` tags.
