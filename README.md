A GitHub Action to create signed and verified commits as the
`github-actions[bot]` User with the standard `GITHUB_TOKEN`. This is
accomplished via the GitHub [REST API] by using the [Blob] and [Tree] endpoints
to build the commit and update the original Ref to point to it. [^1]

After using this Action, your local branch will be updated to point to the newly
created commit, which will be signed and verified using
[GitHub's public PGP key](https://github.com/web-flow.gpg)! Files that were not
committed by the Action will be left staged.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Using this Action with your own [Personal Access Token (PAT)] is **not**
> recommended.  
> See [limitations](#limitations) for more details.

> This action supports Linux, macOS and Windows runners (results may vary with
> self-hosted runners).

## Quick Start

  uses: iarekylew00t/verified-bot-commit@v1
  with:
    message: 'feat: Some changes'
    files: |
      README.md
      *.txt
      src/**/tests/*
      !test-data/dont-include-this

```

## Usage

### Inputs

> `List` type is a newline-delimited string

> 1. Files within your `.gitignore` will not be included. You can also negate
>    any files by prefixing it with `!`
> 2. You must include either `message` or `message-file` (which takes priority).
> 3. Only files that match a pattern you include will be in the final commit,
>    but you can optionally stage files yourself for more control.
> 4. Available options are `info`, `notice`, `warning` and `error`.
> 5. This Action is intended to work with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`. See the
>    [notice](#verified-bot-commit-action) and [limitations](#limitations)

### Outputs

| Name     | Type   | Description                                       |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `blobs`  | JSON   | A JSON list of blob SHAs within the tree          |
| `tree`   | String | SHA of the underlying tree for the commit         |
| `commit` | String | SHA of the commit itself                          |
| `ref`    | String | SHA for the ref that was updated (same as commit) |

### Token Permissions

This Actions requires the following permissions granted to the `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

- `contents: write`

## Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è As always, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot push to protected Refs.

‚ö†Ô∏è The [Blob] API has a 40MiB limit, any files larger than this in your commit
will fail.

‚ö†Ô∏è Using your own [Personal Access Token (PAT)] will result in an unsigned and
unverified commit. You should _really_ look into [using your own keys] and
[signing commits] yourself with the help of Actions like
[webfactory/ssh-agent](https://github.com/webfactory/ssh-agent) and
[crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg](https://github.com/crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg).

## Development

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Since this is a TypeScript action you **must** transpile it into native
> JavaScript. This is done for you automatically as part of the `npm run all`
> command and will be validated via the
> [`check-dist.yml`](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/actions/workflows/check-dist.yml)
> Workflow in any PR.

1. ‚öôÔ∏è Install the version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) as defined in the
   [`.node-version`](.node-version).  
   You can use [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to help manage your
   project runtimes.

   ```sh
   asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git
   asdf install
   ```

2. üõ†Ô∏è Install dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. üèóÔ∏è Format, lint, test, and package your code changes.

   ```sh
   npm run all
   ```

## Releases

For maintainers, the following release process should be used when cutting new
versions.

1. ‚è¨ Ensure all changes are in the `main` branch and all necessary
   [Workflows](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/actions) are
   passing.

   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git pull
   ```

2. ‚úÖ Ensure the [`package.json`](package.json#L4) and
   [`package-lock.json`](package-lock.json#L3) files are updated to with the new
   version being cut.

   ```sh
   npm update
   ```

3. üîñ Create a new Tag, push it up, then create a
   [new Release](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/releases/new)
   for the version.

   ```sh
   git tag v1.2.3
   git push -u origin v1.2.3
   ```

   Alternatively you can create the Tag on the GitHub Release page itself.

   When the tag is pushed it will kick off the
   [Shared Tags](https://github.com/IAreKyleW00t/verified-bot-commit/actions/workflows/shared-tags.yml)
   Workflows to update the `v$MAJOR` and `v$MAJOR.MINOR` tags.
